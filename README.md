# app-altars
This was first invented by me years ago and is published in my books. Altars is a new idea and will revolutionize worship forever. With Altars you can design your perfect altar, as many as you want, and consecrated to any god you choose. Also keep prayers and spells organized.

I used Fiverr a few times to create some quick prototypes of the app. It is not a game, it is an Altar simulation and religous organization application for phones, PCs and Virtual Reality.
